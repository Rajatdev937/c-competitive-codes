# C Competitive Codes 🚀

This repository is created to **document my competitive programming journey in C**.
It will be used to solve and track **algorithmic problems from platforms like LeetCode,
GeeksforGeeks (GFG), and similar coding sites**.

The focus will be on developing a strong **problem-solving mindset, optimization skills,
and clean C implementations**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Types to Be Covered
- Two Sum
- Continuous Subarray Sum
- Prefix Sum based problems
- Sliding Window problems
- Hashing-based array problems
- Optimization-focused problem statements

(Problems will be added progressively as I practice.)
