C Programming & Problem Solving

Welcome to my C Programming Repository!
This repo contains my C programs, practice questions, and problem-solving codes from:

🟢 LeetCode
🧩 GeeksforGeeks
🏁 HackerRank

I’m using this repo to learn and practice C — from basics to slightly advanced topics like pointers and file handling.

🧠 Topics Covered:

Basics of C (loops, functions, conditionals)
Arrays and Strings
Pointers and Structures
File Handling
Sorting & Searching
Simple Data Structures (linked list, stack, queue)
Practice problems from LeetCode and GFG


Run:
gcc filename.c -o output
./output

🎯 Goal 
To build a strong base in C programming and improve problem-solving skills by solving challenges regularly.
